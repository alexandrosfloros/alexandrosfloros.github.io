                    <p>I am currently pursuing an MSc in Artificial Intelligence at the University of Edinburgh, focusing on Natural Language Processing. I received my MEng in Electrical Engineering from the University of Bristol with the thesis topic of Video Compression Using Deep Neural Networks. This is my professional website, containing information about some of my past projects as well as relevant links.</p>
