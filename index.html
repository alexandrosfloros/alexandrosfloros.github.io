                <div id = "overview-text">
                    <p>I am an Electrical and Electronic Engineering MEng student, currently studying at the University of Bristol. I am mainly interested in projects involving communications, signal processing, machine learning, back-end as well as front-end development, and I always look forward for ways to expand my knowledge and explore new ideas to deliver a final product. Each one of my projects started out as a new learning experience with a clear motivation and goal in mind and I regularly update them in order to implement additional features and improvements. Because of this, I am always available for new project ideas and opportunities. Further information about me and my projects can be found in my resume as well as my project portfolio.</p>

                            <p class = "project-text">An application used to analyse a set of points on the plane and identify different geometric shapes, given their mathematical properties. It makes use of a variety of mathematical concepts and theorems from linear algebra and euclidean geometry. Numerous optimisation techniques were utlised to reduce the code’s complexity and improve performance.</p>
