                    <p>I am an Electrical and Electronic Engineering MEng student, currently studying at the University of Bristol. I am mainly interested in innovative projects involving machine learning and software development, back-end as well as front-end. Each one of my projects started out as a new learning experience with a clear motivation and goal in mind, and I like to regularly keep them up-to-date by implementing additional features and improvements. I always look forward for ways of expanding my knowledge and exploring unique ideas to deliver a final product, and, as such, I am open to any work and career opportunities. Further information about me, my background, and my recent work can be found on this website.</p>
