                <p>Alex is an engineer and researcher, specializing in machine learning, data science, and software development. He holds an MSc in Artificial Intelligence from the University of Edinburgh and an MEng in Electrical & Electronic Engineering from the University of Bristol. His work in AI primarily focuses on computer vision and natural language processing (NLP).</p>
                    
                <p>During his time at Edinburgh, Alex built a strong foundation in NLP. Towards the completion of his studies, he implemented and developed novel self-supervised auxiliary tasks to enhance vision transformer models in low-data environments. At Bristol, his interests were particularly aligned with signal processing and mobile communications. In his final year, he worked with generative adversarial networks to improve the video compression efficiency of state-of-the-art standards. He previously interned with researchers applying object detection models to robotics. His CV is available at the top of this page.</p>
