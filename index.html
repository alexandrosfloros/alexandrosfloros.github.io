                    <p>I graduated with an MSc in Artificial Intelligence at the University of Edinburgh, specializing on Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing. My dissertation focused on the development and implementation of novel self-supervised auxiliary tasks to enhance vision transformer models under limited data. I received a MEng in Electrical Engineering from the University of Bristol, where, as part of my thesis, generative adversarial networks were used to improve video compression efficiency of state-of-the-art standards. This is my personal website, containing information about me as well as relevant links.</p>
